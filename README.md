# Introduction

This repository contains a real-time chat application built using Laravel 8 as the backend, Vue.js 3 for the frontend, and Socket.IO for real-time bi-directional communication. It showcases how to integrate these technologies to build a scalable and robust chat system.

The chat application supports the creation and broadcast of messages in real-time, leveraging Laravel's powerful event broadcasting capabilities and Vue.js's reactive interface. Laravel Echo and Socket.IO are used to handle real-time events and push them to the client-side application.
